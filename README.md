This repository showcases practical examples of Flutter testing concepts, aiming to empower developers to embrace Test-Driven Development (TDD) 💡. It provides hands-on examples for building a simple Flutter application with 100% test coverage using unit, widget, and integration tests.

## Why Test? 🤔

Writing tests might seem like extra work, but it offers significant benefits:

* **Confidence:** Ensures your app works as expected and prevents regressions (breaking existing features) when you make changes.
* **Better Design:** Thinking about how to test your code often leads to more modular and maintainable designs.
* **Clearer Requirements (especially when using AI):** Tests act as executable specifications. Writing tests first (TDD) helps clarify requirements, which can lead to more accurate results, even when using AI code generation tools. Tests confirm the AI understood the task correctly.
* **Collaboration:** Tests serve as documentation for how components are supposed to behave.

## Who is this Repository For? 👥

This repository is designed for a wide range of Flutter developers:

* **AI-assisted Coders ("Vibe Coders"):** If you leverage AI for development, understanding testing basics can help you guide the AI more effectively and verify its output. Start with the basic Widget Testing examples!
* **Junior Developers:** New to Flutter or testing? Find simple, clear examples of unit and widget tests to get started. Look for the "Getting Started" pointers below.
* **Experienced Flutter Developers (New to Testing):** Comfortable with Flutter but want to add testing to your skill set? Explore practical examples for testing state management (BLoC/Cubit, Riverpod), routing, and mocking dependencies.
* **Experienced Testers:** Already familiar with Flutter testing? Discover different approaches, review patterns, and consider contributing your expertise!

## Getting Started 🚀

Follow these steps to get the project running locally and execute the tests:

**1. Prerequisites:**

* Ensure you have `fvm` or the [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) version 3.29.x installed on your system.

**2. Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Peetee06/flutter-testing-concepts.git
   cd flutter-testing-concepts
   ```

**3. Choose an App & Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate into the directory of the app implementation you'd like to explore (`bloc_app` or `riverpod_app`) and fetch the dependencies.

   *For the BLoC/Cubit version:*

   ```bash
   cd bloc_app
   flutter pub get
   ```

   *For the Riverpod version:*

   ```bash
   cd riverpod_app
   flutter pub get 
   ```

**4. Run Tests:**

* **Unit & Widget Tests:** Run all tests within the `test` directory (Make sure you are inside the `bloc_app` or `riverpod_app` directory):

  ```bash
  flutter test
  ```

* **Integration Tests:** Run the end-to-end tests located in the `integration_test` directory. You may need a running simulator/emulator or a connected device (Make sure you are inside the `bloc_app` or `riverpod_app` directory).

  ```bash
  flutter test integration_test
  ```

Now you're ready to explore the code and run the various test examples!

## Repository Structure 📁

The repository contains two implementations of the same sample application, each utilizing a different state management solution:

* `bloc_app/`: An implementation using the BLoC/Cubit pattern for state management 🧱.
* `riverpod_app/`: An implementation using Riverpod for state management 💧.

Both applications demonstrate comprehensive testing strategies relevant to their respective state management approaches.
