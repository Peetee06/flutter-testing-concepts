# Git and GitHub rules

Follow these rules closely when working with git and GitHub.

## General Rules

- before committing anything, make sure to run `dart format` and `dart analyze` and fix any issues you find, make sure to stage any files changed in this process

### GitHub

- The owner of this repository is `Peetee06`
- The repository is called `flutter-testing-concepts`
- The default branch is `main` - use it as the base branch when creating new branches if not otherwise specified

### Commit messages

Prefix commit messages depending on the changes

- features: `feat:`
- refactorings: `refactor:`
- bug fixes: `fix:`
- only tests: `test:` - if tests are part of a feature addition, use `feat:`
- everything in the `.github` directory as well as configuration files related to continuous integration like `.coderabbit.yaml` or `codecov.yml`: `ci:`
- documentation: `docs:`
- cleanups, dependency updates, SDK updates, etc.: `chore:`

## Pull Request creation

When asked to open a Pull Request follow these steps

1. Verify if you are on the `main` branch using `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD | cat` command
   1. If you are on `main`:
      1. create a new branch with a fitting name and using a prefix like for commit messages
      2. checkout the new branch you created
      3. publish the new branch
   2. If you are on another branch, continue with the next step
2. Stage all files if the user did not specify any specific files to commit
3. Commit everything with a meaningful commit message
4. Create the Pull Request with a meaningful title using the same prefix as for commit messages and use the [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](mdc:.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) for the description containing a concise summary of the changes
